# Simulations of SDEs

## 📌 Mini-project in Jupyter Notebook to better visualize some Stochastic Differential Equations <br>

📈 Model overview: <br>
  ✏️ Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process <br>
  ✏️ Gompertz/Fox process <br>
  ✏️ Black-Scholes process (Geometric Brownian Motion) <br>

⚙️ Numerical method used: Euler-Maruyama Method 
  
📖 I have additionally added a small and informal analysis interpreting the results obtained <br>
